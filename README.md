Part I
======

* `gutenberg/{1,2,3}.html` are from `http://gutenberg.org/files/{46,?,?}`,
  respectively, in HTML + assets format.
* For each file, the existing inline CSS has been deleted, and a `link` tag
  referencing `common.css` has been inserted.
* Additionally, paths to images have been rewritten in each file, since the
  locations of images relative to the document have been changed. Specifically,
  `images/` has been rewritten to `images-{1,2,3}/` (for `{1,2,3}.html`
  respectively), and the images have been moved correspondingly.
